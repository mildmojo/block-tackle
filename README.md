# block-tackle

This module runs a background timer to check whether synchronous code has
blocked the Node.js event loop for too long. When combined with app-specific
logging, this can help you figure out what actions are blocking your runtime.
For example, if you see a blocking message alongside your file upload log
messages, maybe your upload post-processing is blocking the process.

Out of the box, the module logs blocking behavior in the form:

`Event loop blocked for 2.8s (PID 2189)`

This module currently has no dependencies.

## Behavior

On construction, a BlockTackle object starts an internal timer that fires
every `checkInterval` milliseconds. It measures the time since the timer was
queued and fires a `blocked` event if the total time is more than `minBlockTime`
milliseconds.

I've been using similar code (NOT this module) in a production app for a couple
of years. I'm not the first one to come up with this idea, but I couldn't find
a pre-existing node module for it.

## Usage

```javascript
const BlockTackle = require('block-tackle');
const tackler = new BlockTackle({ checkInterval: 500, minBlockTime: 3000 });

// Providing an event listener turns off built-in log messages.
tackler.on('blocked', blockTime => {
  const blockSeconds = (blockTime / 1000).toFixed(1);
  console.log(`We got blocked for ${blockSeconds}s!`);
});

...

// Before process exit, stop the timer so it doesn't keep the process running.
tackler.stop();
```

## Tests

Run the tests with `npm test`.
